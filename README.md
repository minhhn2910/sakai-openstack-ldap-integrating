Ongoing project
================================
The purpose of this project is to use Openstack as a cloud service for the University's elearning  portal
Originally, students have Sakai accounts for elearning service, which include many courses. Some of those courses may need to use Computing service. 
Openstack are being emerged as one of the most popular cloud infrastructure  which provides virtual machine to support such services.
We migrate all existing users in sakai to [LDAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol)
Via LDAP, Openstack's Keystone service can authenticate Sakai's users
The detailed readme will be updated soon
